# SURVEY QUESTIONS
# =========================
questions = [
    {
        "label": "<b>HUMILITY</b> (<i>Mababang loob o Mapagpakumbaba</i>)",
        "description": "The posture of the heart that recognizes one‚Äôs complete dependence on God, placing His will above personal pride, ambition, or self-sufficiency. It is the acknowledgement that all wisdom, strength, and provision come from Him (James 4:6; Philippians 2:3‚Äì8; Matthew 5:5), and therefore one lives not for self-exaltation but for God‚Äôs glory and the good of others. Humility is expressed through obedience to God, service to others, a teachable spirit, and a willingness to submit rather than dominate. It reflects the character of Christ, who, though equal with God, emptied Himself and became a servant, ultimately modeling perfect humility in His life, death, and resurrection.",
        "anchors": [
            "A spirit of competition, boasting, or arrogance dominates, especially in board meetings. Members rarely apologize or seek reconciliation when conflicts arise.",
            "Leaders and members sometimes seek forgiveness and reconciliation, though these behaviors are rarely noticed.",
            "Members consistently value others above themselves, act with gentleness, respect, and courtesy, and seek reconciliation when conflicts arise."
        ]
    },
    {
        "label": "<b>ENDURANCE in the Faith</b> (<i>Matiyagang nagpapatuloy, Nananatiling tapat, o Nagtitiyaga hanggang wakas</i>)",
        "description": "Endurance in the faith is the steadfast perseverance to remain faithful to God and His promises despite trials, suffering, or opposition. It is the spiritual strength to press on in obedience and hope, trusting that God is working all things for good and that His reward is sure. Scripture exhorts believers to ‚Äúrun with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus‚Äù (Hebrews 12:1‚Äì2), to ‚Äúrejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance‚Äù (Romans 5:3‚Äì4), and to remain steadfast under trial, for ‚Äúwhen he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life‚Äù (James 1:12, 1Corinthians 13:7). Endurance, therefore, is both a gift of God‚Äôs sustaining grace and the believer‚Äôs faithful response to keep walking with Christ until the end.",
        "anchors": [
            "People leave or disengage when challenges arise. Ministry participation is minimal or conditional.",
            "Members tend to participate only when convenient and rarely persevere through difficulties or changes.",
            "The community demonstrates consistent faithfulness, perseverance, adaptability, and willingness to serve despite difficulty or personal sacrifice."
        ]
    },
    {
        "label": "<b>AUTHENTICITY</b> (<i>Pusong Dalisay, malinis na budhi, at tapat na pananampalataya o mabuting loob</i>)",
        "description": "Authenticity is living with integrity and sincerity before God and others, where one‚Äôs inner life aligns with outward actions. It is the opposite of hypocrisy, calling believers to be genuine in faith, speech, and conduct, reflecting the truth of Christ within them. Scripture reminds us to live in the light, for ‚Äúwhoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God‚Äù (John 3:21), and to ‚Äúlet love be genuine‚Äù (Romans 12:9). Authenticity means walking in truth (3 John 1:4, 1 Timothy 1:5), confessing weaknesses honestly, and allowing God‚Äôs Spirit to shape a life that is real, transparent, and consistent with the gospel.",
        "anchors": [
            "Attendance is mostly habitual or for appearances; kindness, generosity, and public testimonies are minimal.",
            "Members show support, encouragement, and eagerness to have fellowship with one another, though these behaviors are not yet consistent.",
            "Members show kindness, hospitality, and mercy. They support, encourage, and pray for one another, visit the sick, and assist those in need."
        ]
    },
    {
        "label": "<b>LOVE</b> (<i>Pag-ibig</i>)",
        "description": "Love is the highest virtue and the defining mark of the Christian life, as beautifully described in 1 Corinthians 13. It is not merely an emotion but a selfless commitment to seek the good of others, grounded in God‚Äôs own love. Paul teaches that love is patient and kind; it does not envy, boast, or act with pride. It is not rude, self-seeking, or easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love rejoices with the truth, always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres (1 Corinthians 13:4‚Äì7). Unlike gifts or accomplishments that will pass away, love is eternal, for ‚Äúthe greatest of these is love‚Äù (1 Corinthians 13:13).",
        "anchors": [
            "Hostility, factions, or selfish ambition are present; relationships are strained or divisive.",
            "Members are generally amicable and respectful, but relationships lack depth or sustained care.",
            "Members show love for one another, enjoy fellowship, share resources, pray for each other, and participate in communal activities beyond the confines of the church building."
        ]
    },
    {
        "label": "<b>TRUSTWORTHINESS</b> (<i>Mapagkakatiwalaan</i>)",
        "description": "Trustworthiness is the quality of being faithful, reliable, and dependable in character and action, reflecting the steadfastness of God Himself. Scripture calls believers to let their ‚ÄúYes‚Äù be yes and their ‚ÄúNo‚Äù be no (Matthew 5:37), showing integrity in word and deed. A trustworthy person keeps promises, fulfills responsibilities, and acts with honesty, echoing the wisdom of Proverbs 12:22: ‚ÄúThe Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy.‚Äù Ultimately, trustworthiness is rooted in God‚Äôs faithfulness (Lamentations 3:22‚Äì23), and believers are called to mirror His character by living with integrity so that others may confidently depend on their word and witness.",
        "anchors": [
            "Mistrust and suspicion dominate; contempt or open criticism is common.",
            "Some discord exists, but most members generally respect and affirm leadership.",
            "The congregation fully trusts leadership, and leaders consistently demonstrate integrity and biblical alignment in life and ministry."
        ]
    },
    {
        "label": "<b>HARMONY</b> (<i>Pakikiisa at Nagkaisa</i>)",
        "description": "Harmony or peace within a community of believers is the unity and mutual love that flows from Christ‚Äôs reconciling work, binding diverse people together as one body under His lordship. Believers are called to ‚Äúmake every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace‚Äù (Ephesians 4:3) and to ‚Äúlive in harmony with one another‚Äù (Romans 12:16), showing patience, forgiveness, and compassion. This peace is not merely the absence of conflict but the active presence of reconciliation, encouragement, and shared life in Christ, who Himself is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). When believers ‚Äúlet the peace of Christ rule in [their] hearts‚Äù (Colossians 3:15), the church becomes a living testimony of God‚Äôs kingdom marked by love, unity, and mutual upbuilding.",
        "anchors": [
            "Gossip, jealousy, unresolved conflicts, or division are common.",
            "Past conflicts may remain unresolved, but members are increasingly sensitive to reconciliation and avoiding repeated mistakes.",
            "Conflicts are addressed with forgiveness and understanding. Members and leaders apologize readily, maintain peace, and cultivate strong relational bonds."
        ]
    },
    {
        "label": "<b>YEARNING for Truth</b> (<i>Kinagagalak ang katotohanan</i>)",
        "description": "Yearning for truth is the deep longing of the heart to know, embrace, and live according to God‚Äôs Word, for He Himself is the source of all truth. Scripture teaches that Jesus is ‚Äúthe way, the truth, and the life‚Äù (John 14:6), and those who belong to Him are called to seek His truth earnestly, like the psalmist who prays, ‚ÄúTeach me your way, Lord, that I may rely on your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name‚Äù (Psalm 86:11, 1 Corinthians 13:6). This yearning is expressed in a hunger for God‚Äôs Word (Psalm 119:105, 160), a desire to walk in integrity, and a willingness to reject falsehood and deception. It is the Spirit of truth (John 16:13) who guides believers into a deeper knowledge of Christ, shaping them to love truth and live by it in every aspect of life.",
        "anchors": [
            "Members show little interest in Scripture, prayer, or personal spiritual growth.",
            "Members engage in discipleship, and other faith-building activities, though their participation and personal practice are not yet consistent.",
            "Members actively seek to learn, study Scripture, grow in faith, disciple others, and apply biblical principles in daily life."

For each area of church health, you‚Äôll see **three reference descriptions**:

- One that reflects an **unhealthy pattern**  
- One that shows a **growing** or **developing** state  
- One that represents a **healthy, ideal** state

Please reflect on your church honestly, then rate your church from **1 to 10**:

- **1‚Äì3** ‚Üí Closely resembles the unhealthy description  
- **4‚Äì7** ‚Üí Somewhere in between; growing in this area  
- **8‚Äì10** ‚Üí Strongly reflects the healthy description

Within each range, lower numbers mean worse health and higher numbers mean better health. For example, in the 1‚Äì3 range, 1 is more unhealthy than 2, and 2 is more unhealthy than 3. This same principle applies across the scale (4‚Äì7 and 8‚Äì10): higher numbers always indicate better health.
