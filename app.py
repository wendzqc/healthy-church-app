For each area of church health, you’ll see **three descriptions**:

- One that reflects an **unhealthy pattern**  
- One that shows a **growing** or **developing** state  
- One that represents a **healthy, ideal** state

Please reflect on your church honestly, then rate your church from **1 to 10**:

- **1–3** → Closely resembles the unhealthy description  
- **4–7** → Somewhere in between; growing in this area  
- **8–10** → Strongly reflects the healthy description
